# ADF-project---Copy-Files-Between-Blob-Containers-with-Empty-File-Skip
This project demonstrates using Azure Data Factory to copy files from one Azure Blob Storage container to another, automatically skipping empty files during the process. The pipeline efficiently transfers only non-empty files, optimizing storage and processing time in cloud data workflows.
